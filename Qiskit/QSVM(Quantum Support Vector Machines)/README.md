What is a Support Vector Machine?

A support vector machine is a supervised machine learning method that is trained using a dataset and will predict if a particular observation is in a certain class based upon what it has been trained on. It is similar to a linear classifier in that it uses a hyperplane to separate classes.

 However along with the hyperplane support vectors are used. These are essentially data points that are used to maximise the margin and thus the distance between the classes. 

However the Quantum  Support Vector Machine is different in that it uses a feature map to map data points to a quantum circuit.
